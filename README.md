# Book List
## General info
Django project, where you can add books to your own library/ list.
How to fill your list:

* import books using external api (google books api) - you just
have to choose title, author or ISBN
to be searched.
* create them yourself with validation included.

Data are stored in postgres db. Whole project is build on docker.
